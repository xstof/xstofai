    "\n",
    "The chosen model architecture can highly impact results.  If, for example, not looking at the time axis,  we compare performance of models between `resnet` and  `convnext_in22` we see a score difference between 83 and 87.  The default choice should no longer be blindly `resnet` as the community has moved on from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond mere scoring, another important factor to take into account is how well an architecture is suiteable for transfer-learning.  [Have a look](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/the-best-vision-models-for-fine-tuning?scriptVersionId=102071666&cellId=16) at `convnext_large_in22k` for example.\n",

    "## GPU Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger architectures will require a GPU with more memory as they have more parameters.  There's however a way to circumvent this.  See [Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Lesson 7](https://youtu.be/p4ZZq0736Po?t=445).\n",
