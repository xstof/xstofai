They can agree upfront on the meaning of a series of bits thrown back and forth over a wall (like some mapping function saying \"0101\" means event \"abc\" happened).  Beyond the bits used for communicating they cannot exchange other information.  Let's now assume a number of different scenarios.\n",

    "\n",
    "A and B can agree to communicate the winning team using 3 bits of information. 3 bits give them $2^3=8$ classes, one for each team.  Let's say \"000\" means team A; \"001\" team B; \"010\" team C and so on.  We can say the entropy for this probability distribution is 3 bits.\n",

    "Imagine we have 2 coins: one fair coin with an equal distribution of 0.5 for each outcome (heads or tails) and a biased coin with probability $p$ for heads and $q$ for tails.  We're trying to measure how different those are.  If $p$ is close to 0.5 then it would be easy to confuse both distributions by looking at the outcomes they generate.  On the opposite side, if $p$ is close to 0.95 for example, then it would be fairly obvious to dinstinguish between both distributions by observing a series of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Then we work out the probability of coin 1 generating this sequence.  To do this we multiply by $p_{1}$ when we see heads and by $p_{2}$ when we see tails: $p_{1} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot p_{1} \\cdot p_{1}$\n",
