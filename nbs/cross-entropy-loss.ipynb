We try to adapt weights to optimize the resulting probabilities to match as close as possible the ground truth.  To iteratively adapt the weights and improve the prediction , a loss function is needed.  For multi-class classification, Cross-Entropy Loss is used."

    "An occurrence of an unlikely event gives more information than the occurrence of a very likely event.  Shannon came up with a way to quantify how unpredictable a series of events is; measuring the \"disorder\" of system and quantifying uncertainty of a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a thought experiment with two people: person A and person B.  They can agree upfront on the meaning of a series of bits thrown back and forth over a wall (like some mapping function saying \"0101\" means event \"abc\" happened.  Beyond the bits used for communicating they cannot exchange other information.  Let's now assume a number of different scenarios.\n",

    "### A fair coin flip\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume person A does a fair coin flip where the probability distribution of having heads is the same as having tails, each begin 50 percent:  $P(H)=0.5$ and $P(T)=0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both A and B can agree to exchange the outcome of the coin flip using a single bit of information where 0 means heads and 1 means tails.  When B receives the bit, he will know exactly what the outcome of the coin flip was.  We can say the entropy of this probability distribution is 1 bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Winning team out of 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume on the one side of the wall person A observes one team out of 8 winning a tournament.  Each team has a probability of 1/8 or 0.125 of winning, so this is again an equal probability distribution: $P(A)=0.25$, $P(B)=0.25$, $P(C)=0.25$, ..., $P(H)=0.25$\n",
    "\n",
    "A and B can agree to communicate the winning team using 3 bits of information. 3 bits give them $2^3=8$ classes, one for each team.  Let's say \"000\" means team A; \"001\" team B; \"010\" team C and so on.  We can say the entropy for this probability distribution is 3 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we generalize this: for a uniform distribution of M equally possible outcomes, the entropy is: $log_2\\,M$\n",

    "### 10 outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "If A observes an outcome out of equal distributation of 10 possible outcomes (each with a probability of 0.1), then these can all be encoded using 4 bits.  4 bits allows for representing $2^4=16$ states which is more than needed for our 10 possible outcomes.  There are 6 \"unused\" states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can group outcomes in groups of 3.  There are 1000 such unique triplets possible.  If we encode our data per 3 bits, then every triplet can be encoded using 10 bits, giving us a total of $2^10=1024$ states.  That's still too much but we're already much more efficient in encoding out information as we can represent on average 1 outcome = 1/3 triplet using $\\frac{10}{3}=3.333...$ bits.  This is better but not perfect yet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We grouped our information by 3 outcomes at a time; which gave us $10^3$ outcomes.  Let's call the number of items by which we group is G instead of 3. The number of states we can present with B bits is $2^B$.  The most efficient encoding is one where $2^B = 10^G$ where G is the number of grouped observations and B is the number of bits.\n",

    "$$2^B = 10^G$$\n",

    "So for a uniform distribution of M possible outcomes ($U(M)$) in which every probability of an outcome is $p_{1..M} = \\frac{1}{M}$, the entropy is: $$H(U(M))=log_2\\,M$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-uniform distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen before, each outcome with probability $p$ needs $log_2\\,M$ bits to encode or $log_2\\,\\frac{1}{p}$ which is $-log_2\\,p$.  Summing this over an entire distribution and multiplying each possible outcome with its probability gives us the entropy for a non-uniform distribution: $-\\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\,p{i}\\,log_2\\,p_{i}$\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine we have 2 coins: one fair coin with an equal distribution of 0.5 for each outcome (heads or tails) and a biased coin with probability $p$ for heads and $q$ for tails.  We're trying to measure how different those are.  If $p$ is close to 0.5 then it would be easy to confuse both distributions by looking at the outcomes they generate.  On the opposite side, if $p$ is close to 0.95 for example, then it would be fairly obvious to dinstinguish between both distributions by observing a series of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
