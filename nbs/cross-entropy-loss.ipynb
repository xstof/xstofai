    "The output for a neural network doing classification is a set of probabilities (a so-called probability distribution where every class is associated with a probability).  We try to adapt weights to optimize the resulting probabilities to match as close as possible the ground truth.  To iteratively adapt the weights and improve the prediction , a loss function is needed.  For multi-class classification, Cross-Entropy Loss is used."

    "An occurrence of an unlikely event gives more information than the occurrence of a very likely event.  Shannon came up with a way to quantify how unpredictable a series of events is; measuring the \"disorder\" of system and quantifying uncertainty of a probability distribution.\n",

    "Let's do a thought experiment with two people: person A and person B.  They can agree upfront on the meaning of a series of bits thrown back and forth over a wall (like some mapping function saying \"0101\" means event \"abc\" happened.  Beyond the bits used for communicating they cannot exchange other information.  Let's now assume a number of different scenarios.\n",
