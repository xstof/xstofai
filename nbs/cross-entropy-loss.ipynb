On the opposite side, if $p$ is close to 0.95 for example, then it would be fairly obvious to dinstinguish between both distributions by observing a series of outcomes.\n",

For every label we calculate the cross-entropy loss: for \"cat\" that is 0.34, for \"dog\" that is 0.56, for \"panda\" that is 1.2.  The total loss is now just the sum of all the losses for every label: 0.34 + 0.56 + 1.2 = 2.1"
